Attached sheet has data from 1800's about some key metrics, you will
need to load this into PySpark, clean the data (make sure there are no
gaps..use average of the previous 2 reading to plug gaps).

Once you have clean data, create 5yr averages for metrics and add as new
columns....once you have all of this data then import this data into
Qlik or D3 charts (see example below)
